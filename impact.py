"""
Goals:
- Role neutrality: average impact per role = 0 (no built-in bias).
- Bounded scale: player impact always within [-100, 100].
- Stable distribution: roughly bell-shaped, with <1% extreme outliers.
- Historical impacts remain unchanged when new matches are added.
- Temporal consistency: adding or removing a single match should not materially shift long-run player impact averages (e.g. across 100 matches).

Exports:
- calculate_impacts(conn): creates table impact_result (match_id:int64, player_name:varchar, impact:double).
  Creates helper DuckDB views and tables with prefix `v_impact_*`. Avoid relying on them.
